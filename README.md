# Advanced GitHub Projects for Design Teams

Welcome to this interactive tutorial on customizing GitHub Projects for design workflows! This repository will guide you through creating and customizing a design project board using GitHub Projects V2.

## How This Works
As you complete each step, this README will automatically update to show the next task. Follow along to learn advanced GitHub Projects customization step by step.

## Step 1: Create a Design Project and Custom Views
Let's start by creating a specialized project board for design workflows and setting up custom views.

### üìã Task: Create a Design Project with Multiple Views
1. Go to the "Projects" tab at the top of this repository
2. Click "Create project"
3. Select "Board" as the template
4. Name your project "Design Workflow"
5. Click "Create"
6. Now, create the following views:
   - A "Kanban" board view with columns: "Ideation", "Design in Progress", "Ready for Review", "Approved"
   - A "Table" view called "All Designs"
   - A "Roadmap" view called "Design Timeline"

To create a new view:
- Click the dropdown menu next to the current view name (likely "Board")
- Select "New view"
- Choose the view type and give it a name
- Configure the columns/layout as described above

Once completed, go to the **Actions** tab and run the "Complete Step 1" workflow to proceed to the next step.

### üìö What are Project Views?
Views allow you to look at your project data in different ways. A board view helps visualize workflow status, while table views show detailed information in rows and columns. Roadmap views help visualize work along a timeline. Having multiple views of the same data helps teams focus on what matters most for their specific needs.
