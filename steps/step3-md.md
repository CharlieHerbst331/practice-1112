# Advanced GitHub Projects for Design Teams

Welcome to this interactive tutorial on customizing GitHub Projects for design workflows! This repository will guide you through creating and customizing a design project board using GitHub Projects V2.

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Create a Design Project and Custom Views
Congratulations! You've successfully created a design project with multiple views.

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Add Design-Specific Custom Fields
Great job! You've added custom fields to track design-specific information.

## Step 3: Set Up Automations for Your Design Workflow
Let's make your design board more efficient by setting up automated workflows.

### üìã Task: Create Workflow Automations
1. Navigate to your "Design Workflow" project
2. Click on the "..." menu in the top right corner
3. Select "Workflows"
4. Set up the following automations:
   - When an issue is labeled "needs review", automatically move it to "Ready for Review"
   - When an issue is labeled "approved", automatically move it to "Approved"
   - Create an item archive workflow to automatically archive items when they're labeled "completed"

5. Create at least 3 issues in your repository with design-related titles and add them to your project
6. Apply the "needs review" label to one of these issues to test your automation

Once completed, go to the **Actions** tab and run the "Complete Step 3" workflow to proceed to the next step.

### üìö Why Automations Matter in Design Workflows
Automations help reduce manual work and ensure consistent processes. By automatically moving items based on labels or other triggers, you can keep your design workflow running smoothly and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks. This is especially valuable for design teams that need to manage multiple feedback rounds and approvals.
